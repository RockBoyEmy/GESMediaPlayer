# GES-Media-Player 
My Abertay University Semester 2 Android application project for the "Software Development for Mobile Devices" module. This is the revised version.
It makes use of the MediaBrowser functionality of the Android framework, in opposition to the approach in my other "gesMediaPlayer" repo.
It is a version completely re-built from the ground-up.

Will add other details as progress is made.

Right now the idea is to finish the app and have it working really well. Then, might consider pubblication on the Google Play Store.
Might continue development for this application after the end of semester, if interesting and if comes out nicely.
