# GES-Media-Player 
Abertay University, year 2017/2018 - Semester 2 Android application project for the "Software Development for Mobile Devices" module. This is the revised version, completely re-built from the ground-up. 
It makes use of the MediaBrowser functionality of the Android framework, in opposition to my previous approach, with normal services.

It is now in somewhat of a beta stage. It is completed with the absolute basic functionality and a few extras, although unfortunately it doesn't have all the functionality that I initially wanted it to have, not even close. 
There are still lots of bugs, most unseen, because I've did solve most of the visible ones. But because of the complexity and ambitiousness of this project, working on it solo was a lot more time-consuming and difficult than expected. 

For now it will stay here in this release. I completed it in time and for the foreseeable future I am not going to work on it. Will see what will happen later on. I'd definitely need a team, and a lot of spare time (which I don't have) to be able to keep working on this and make something actually good and complete in terms of features and functionality. It was quite an adventure though.
